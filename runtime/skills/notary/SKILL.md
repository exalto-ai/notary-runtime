# Notary

Use the installed `notaryctl` command client for supported operations. It
resolves the daemon's configured loopback address, checks the API version, and
handles configured local authentication without exposing a password in a URL.

## Start safely

1. Run `notaryctl --json status` before acting on daemon state.
2. Use `notaryctl --json traces list --metadata-only` to obtain Trace
   identifiers and timestamps without placing stored prompt or output previews
   in the agent transcript. Operate only on identifiers returned by the daemon.
3. Prefer a documented CLI command. When the CLI does not expose the requested
   operation, fetch `/openapi.json` from the configured loopback admin origin
   and follow that installed contract rather than a memorized route or schema.
4. Ask for confirmation before notarizing a Trace, retrying proof work,
   connecting or disconnecting an account, or sharing a trace.
5. Read [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) before performing a
   state-changing operation or diagnosing a failed operation.

## Protect private evidence

- Never request, decrypt, print, upload, or expose `.llmcapture` contents,
  provider credentials, cookies, authenticated header
  values, admin passwords, hosted account credentials, or vault material.
- Treat a `.llmtrace` as disclosed evidence, not as private input. Explain that
  its request and response bodies remain visible even though header values are
  hidden by policy.
- Run `notaryctl traces show` only when the user explicitly asks to disclose
  the notarized request and response bodies in the current agent transcript.
- Never describe a successfully opened Trace or package as cryptographically
  verified. Use `notaryctl traces verify` and report its exact result.
- Never share a trace without the user's separate approval. Default to an
  unlisted link unless the user explicitly requests public Trace discovery.

## Handle authentication

If the daemon requires admin authentication, do not guess or ask the user to
paste the password into a command. Ask for an approved private password-file
path and pass it with `--admin-password-file`. Never read, print, log, or
persist the password itself.

## Report precisely

- Distinguish Captured and Notarized Trace states from operational status,
  verification outcome, and sharing progress.
- Treat notarization and sharing as asynchronous. Preserve returned operation
  or share identifiers and poll only the documented status operation.
- Branch on stable JSON fields and `error.code`; do not parse human-readable
  prose when `--json` is available.
- Do not assume list ordering, defaults, or pagination semantics that the live
  contract does not state. Compare returned timestamps when the user asks for
  the newest or oldest record.
- If the live OpenAPI document lacks the requested operation, explain that the
  installed daemon does not support it and stop.
